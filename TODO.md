# Per - TODO

## Milestone 0.2.0
- eliminate duplicates from headers (maybe also parameters), maybe QSet?
- combobox should be populated in code
- about.h file + menu entry
- cpack deployment (see [this](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/cmake-deployment.html))
- when url text changes, parameters should be updated accordingly
- when parameter table changes, url text should be updated accordingly
        -> both of these require a rewrite that also contains the index of the pair <-
